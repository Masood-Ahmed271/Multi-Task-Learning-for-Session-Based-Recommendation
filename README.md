## Description:

This repository contains the code and the paper written on the topic for 'Multi-Task Learning for Session Based Recommendation'.

## Abstract:

Session-based recommendation systems use users’ previous or current behavior in a sequence of actions, known as a
”session,” to provide personalized suggestions. However, these systems may not always yield satisfactory results, particularly in finding
cold-start users. To address this issue, we propose a combined method that uses both session-based recommendation and multi-task
learning algorithms to obtain more accurate predictions. On the other hand, multi-task learning (MTL) involves learning multiple related
tasks simultaneously to maximize performance. This method has better performance and efficiency when the tasks are related. On the
other hand, the session-based recommendation is widely used in e-commerce or multimedia streaming services to predict users’ next
preferences based on their previous interactions in sessions. Combining the advantages of session-based recommendation and
multi-task learning, we aim to compensate for each other’s disadvantages and make more accurate predictions. We propose to test this
combined approach on the Tenrec dataset produced by Tencent. Our proposed method may have better performance than using these
algorithms separately.
